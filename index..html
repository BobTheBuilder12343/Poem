<h1 style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">Still I Rise</h1>
<h2 style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">By: Maya Angelou</h2>
<p style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">You may write me down in history</br>
With your bitter, twisted lies,</br>
You may trod me in the very dirt</br>
But still, like dust, I'll rise.</p>

<p style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">Does my sassiness upset you?</br>
Why are you beset with gloom?</br>
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells</br>
Pumping in my living room.</p>

<p style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">Just like moons and like suns,</br>
With the certainty of tides,</br>
Just like hopes springing high,</br>
Still I'll rise.</p>

<p style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">Did you want to see me broken?</br>
Bowed head and lowered eyes?</br>
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,</br>
Weakened by my soulful cries?</p>

<p style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">Does my haughtiness offend you?</br>
Don't you take it awful hard</br>
’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines</br>
Diggin’ in my own backyard.</p>

<p style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">You may shoot me with your words,</br>
You may cut me with your eyes,</br>
You may kill me with your hatefulness,</br>
But still, like air, I’ll rise.</p>

<p style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">Does my sexiness upset you?</br>
Does it come as a surprise</br>
That I dance like I've got diamonds</br>
At the meeting of my thighs?</p>

<p style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">Out of the huts of history’s shame I rise</br>
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain I rise</br>
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,</br>
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.</p>

<p style="color:c0c5c1; text-align: center">Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise</br>
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear I rise</br>
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,</br>
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.</br>
I rise</br>
I rise</br>
I rise</p>
